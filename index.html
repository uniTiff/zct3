                    <p>We are a group of high schoolers from Slovakia, and for the second time, we are competing in the CanSat competition. Our passion for technology and innovation drives us forward, and we are always eager to learn and improve. Innovating in this industry requires not only knowledge but also creativity, determination, and teamwork. Every challenge we face is an opportunity to expand our skills and understanding, pushing us to think outside the box and find new solutions. <br><br>

                        We embrace every obstacle as a stepping stone toward our goal, constantly striving to improve and make an impact. No matter how difficult the journey, we remain committed to our vision and excited about the future. <br><br>
                        
                        We are the Zochova CanSat Team 3—driven by curiosity, united by ambition, and ready to take on the challenge!

                <div class="shadow">
                <p>The CanSat competition is about designing, building, testing, and launching a simulated satellite. This satellite must strictly adhere to key rules, including specific weight, height, width, and depth limits, while also staying within a tight budget. <br><br>
                    The satellite's mandatory base mission is to measure altitude and temperature and transmit this data to the ground station. Each team can have a maximum of six members, making teamwork an essential part of the challenge. The competition pushes every aspect of the team’s skills, from engineering and problem-solving to communication and collaboration. <br><br>
                    Before the launch, teams must go through three design reviews, each with a strict deadline, ensuring that every project meets the necessary requirements and is ready for flight.</p>

                    <p>Our secondary mission for the CanSat competition builds upon our primary mission. This year, we aim to enhance our secondary mission with essential components to better understand the descent process and monitor the satellite's condition. While carrying additional secondary missions in the payload area.
                        The mission includes: <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Position tracking using a GNSS module and ceramic antenna. </li>
                            <li>Acceleration and rotation measurement with a gyroscope and IMU.</li>
                            <li>Data logging via an SD card.</li>
                            <li>Payload area for additional secondary missions and extra sensors.</li>
                            <li>Optimized microcontroller selection with a precisely chosen 32-bit MCU.</li>
                            <li>Use of sodium-ion batteries for improved power efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Code optimization with FreeRTOS and enhanced error handling.</li>
                            <li>Modular design with interchangeable satellite covers (one with a camera, one without) and a flexible payload area for various missions.</li>
                            <li>This setup ensures adaptability, efficiency, and improved data collection in our secondary mission.</li>
